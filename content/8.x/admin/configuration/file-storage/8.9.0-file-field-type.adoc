== Intro

File fields allow you to associate uploaded files (such as documents or images) with your entities. These fields are managed by the media uploader system and support various storage backends.

=== How File Fields Work

When a field is configured as type `file`, it enables file upload and management for that field. The system uses the configured storage backend to store and retrieve files, and links the uploaded file metadata to the entity record.

To use a file field, you must specify the `storage_type` in the field's `metadata` configuration. This tells the system which storage backend to use for the uploaded files.

To understand how the media uploader and storage system works, please refer to the link:../8.9.0-file-storage-configuration/[File Storage Configuration Reference].

It is also important to know the link:../8.9.0-media-object-lifecycle[lifecycle of media objects] to understand how files are managed in the system.

=== Configuration Example

To define an file field in your vardefs:

Minimal configuration:
[source,php]
----
'file' => [
    'name' => 'file',
    'vname' => 'LBL_FILE',
    'type' => 'file',
    'source' => 'non-db',
    'reportable' => false,
    'importable' => false,
    'metadata' => [
        'storage_type' => 'private-documents', // Required!
    ],
],
----

Full configuration with max upload size option:
[source,php]
----
'file' => [
    'name' => 'file',
    'vname' => 'LBL_FILE',
    'type' => 'file',
    'source' => 'non-db',
    'reportable' => false,
    'importable' => false,
    'metadata' => [
        'storage_type' => 'private-documents', // Required!
        'upload_maxsize' => 10000000, // Optional, defaults to global config
    ],
],
----

=== Configuration Options

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Option | Description | Required

| `type`
| Must be set to `file`
| Yes

| `storage_type`
| The storage backend to use for this field. Must match a configured storage (e.g., `private-documents`, `public-images`). See the link:../8.9.0-file-storage-configuration/[File Storage Configuration Reference].
| Yes

| `upload_maxsize`
| Maximum allowed file size in bytes.
| No

|===

=== Declaring Storage Types

The `storage_type` must correspond to a storage defined in your media configuration (see link:../8.9.0-file-storage-configuration/[File Storage Configuration Reference]). Example storage types include:

- `private-documents`
- `archived-documents`
- `private-images`
- `public-images`
- `public-documents`

If you do not declare a valid `storage_type`, file uploads will not work for this field.
