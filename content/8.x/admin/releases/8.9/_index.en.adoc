==== icon:email[] Upgrade/Migration Notes - Campaigns & Email Marketing

When upgrading or migrating to SuiteCRM 8.9 from a previous version, Email Marketing Records will be updated as follows:

* Records with status `inactive` will be changed to `draft` (the equivalent status in SuiteCRM 8).
* A new field `type` will be set to `Legacy` to distinguish migrated records from those created in SuiteCRM 8.
* Two new fields will be added:
** `Status` — set to `Sent`
** `Queueing Status` — set to `Finished`

==== icon:level-up-alt[] Setup Changes

===== New Schedulers entrypoint

{{% notice note %}}
Note: This new entrypoint replaces the legacy cron.
{{% /notice %}}

A new entrypoint for running schedulers is available as a Symfony command. You can execute it via CLI or set it up as a cron job:

----
php bin/console schedulers:run
----

This command runs all schedulers that are due at the time of execution.

To configure a cron job for the web server user (usually `www-data`), use:
----
sudo crontab -e -u www-data
----

Add the following line to the crontab (replace `[path/to/php]` and `[path/to/suite/instance]` as needed):

----
* * * * * [path/to/php] [path/to/suite/instance]/bin/console {-e [env]} schedulers:run > /dev/null 2>&1
----

{{% notice note %}}
Note: `{-e [env]}` is optional and specifies the environment.
{{% /notice %}}

To see more information about Schedulers, see link:../../administration-panel/schedulers[here.]

==== icon:star[] Enhancements

===== icon:file[] New File Upload Field Types & Storage Options

SuiteCRM 8.9 introduces two new field types for handling file uploads: `file` and `attachment`.

* **file** - For single file uploads.
* **attachment** - For multiple file uploads.

These field types leverage the media uploader system, allowing files to be stored in various backends, including local storage and external services like AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage.

Currently, there are 5 storage types:

* `private_documents` — stored in `uploads/documents`
* `public_documents` — stored in `public/media-upload/documents`
* `private_images` — stored in `uploads/images`
* `public_images` — stored in `public/media-upload/images`
* `archived_documents` — stored in `uploads/archived`

By default, the Attachment field type uses the `private_documents` storage type, as defined in the field metadata.

To see more information about configuring external storage services, see the documentation section above.

{{% notice note %}}
Note: The file upload does not yet support uploading Documents or Notes.

==== icon:cog[] New Schedulers Added

SuiteCRM 8.9 introduces 3 new schedulers:

* **Queue Email Marketing** — Queues Email Marketing Records that are scheduled to be sent.
* **Send Campaign Emails** — Sends the queued emails for Email Marketing Records.
* **Clean Up Temporary Files** — Cleans up temporary files.

===== icon:paint-brush[] Email Compose Redesign - Phase 1

image:Email-Compose.png[Email-Compose.png]

The Email Compose window has been redesigned in SuiteCRM 8!

The To, CC, and BCC fields support searching and selecting from SuiteCRM Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Users, or individual email addresses
using the new Multi-Flex-Relate field.

Attachments can now be included when sending emails.

You are able to insert an Email Template which, when sending, will parse the variables based on the selected Related To record.

The Body field has been updated to use the squire editor, providing more options for formatting.

You can select an email address from any record in List View, Record View, or Dashlet to open a new compose window pre-addressed to that contact.

You can see more information about Campaigns link:../../../user/modules/_campaigns/[here.]

===== icon:email[] Outbound Email Default

You can now select a Default Outbound Email Account. This will be used as the pre-selected Outbound Account when composing a Campaign or Email.

For newly created users, the first personal outbound created will automatically be set as their default. This can be updated via
the "Actions" dropdown on the record.
