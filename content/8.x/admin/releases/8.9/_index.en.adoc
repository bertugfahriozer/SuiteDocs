==== icon:email[] Upgrade/Migration Notes - Campaigns & Email Marketing

When upgrading or migrating to SuiteCRM 8.9 from a previous version, Email Marketing Records will be updated as follows:

* Records with status `inactive` will be changed to `draft` (the equivalent status in SuiteCRM 8).
* A new field `type` will be set to `Legacy` to distinguish migrated records from those created in SuiteCRM 8.
* Two new fields will be added:
** `Status` — set to `Sent`
** `Queueing Status` — set to `Finished`

==== icon:level-up-alt[] Setup Changes

===== New Schedulers entrypoint

A new entrypoint for running schedulers is available as a Symfony command. You can execute it via CLI or set it up as a cron job:

----
php bin/console schedulers:run
----

To see more information about Schedulers, and setting up the new configuration see link:../../administration-panel/schedulers[here.]

ℹ️ This new entrypoint replaces the legacy cron and needs to be enabled in order to run new symfony side schedulers.

==== icon:star[] Enhancements

===== icon:paint-brush[] Campaigns

===== icon:paint-brush[] Email Compose Redesign

The Email Compose modal has been redesigned in SuiteCRM 8!

This release introduces a brand new and redesigned compose modal that aims to provide a better user experience, including:

* A configurable compose modal that can be collapsed and can remain open while navigating the app.
* To, CC, and BCC fields that support searching and selecting from SuiteCRM Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Users, or individual email addresses using the new Multi-Flex-Relate field.
* Attachments implemented using the new storage system.
* Ability to insert an Email Template which, when sending, will parse the variables based on the selected Related To record.
* The Body field now uses the lightweight Squire editor, offering consistent, rich text editing tailored for emails.
* Email address links in Suite 8 views open a new compose modal pre-addressed to that contact.

Even more is planned for the compose modal, the following releases will bring more features such as: saving drafts and attaching existing documents.

===== icon:file[] New File and Attachment Field Types

SuiteCRM 8.9 introduces two new field types for handling file uploads: `file` and `attachment`.

**File type**

* Designed for uploading files to a field. This field type is ideal for scenarios where only one file needs to be associated with a record, such as uploading a profile picture, a single contract, or a receipt. The uploaded file is stored using the new media storage system, supporting various backends like local storage, AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage.
* For more information see link:../../../developer/metadata/fields/field-types/file[File Field Type] documentation.

**Attachment type**

* Built for attaching multiple items to a record. Unlike the `file` field, the `attachment` field, by default, always allows users to associate several files at once. Additionally, in future releases we plan to add support not only for file uploads but also linking existing documents from the Documents module, and potentially other types of attachments. This will make it suitable for use cases like attaching supporting documents, reference materials, or related files to a record.
* For more information see link:../../../developer/metadata/fields/field-types/attachment[Attachment Field Type] documentation.

ℹ️ Documents and Notes do not yet use the new fields or the new storage system. The migration of these modules to SuiteCRM 8 version will be provided in a future release.

===== icon:file[] New Media Storage System

{{% notice note %}}
This release does not yet include a migration path for old files stored in the legacy `upload` directory. A migration path will be provided in a future release.
{{% /notice %}}

These field types leverage the media uploader system, which allows files to be stored in various backends: local storage, AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

A new concept of "storage types" has been introduced to define different storage backends and locations for different use cases. Each storage type can be linked to a different storage system, e.g. it is possible to have `private_documents` pointing to Azure blobs while `private_images` points to AWS S3. This should give system admins flexibility in how and where files are stored.

Currently, there are 5 storage types:

* `private_documents` — stored in `uploads/documents`
* `public_documents` — stored in `public/media-upload/documents`
* `private_images` — stored in `uploads/images`
* `public_images` — stored in `public/media-upload/images`
* `archived_documents` — stored in `uploads/archived`

To see more information about configuring external storage services, see link:../../configuration/file-storage[File Storage Configuration] documentation.



===== Multi-Relate


Multi-Relate fields have been added to SuiteCRM 8.

You can now relate multiple associated records at once (see below). For more information see link:../../../developer/metadata/fields/field-types/multirelate/[Multi Relate] documentation.

ℹ️ For the moment this field is not available in the Studio. A future release will include Studio support.

==== icon:cog[] New Schedulers Added

SuiteCRM 8.9 introduces 3 new schedulers:

* **Queue Email Marketing** — Queues Email Marketing Records that are scheduled to be sent.
* **Send Campaign Emails** — Sends the queued emails for Email Marketing Records.
* **Clean Up Temporary Files** — Cleans up temporary files.
* **Prune Database scheduler** — Prune Database scheduler has been moved to symfony side and now also removes media objects from the new storage system.

===== icon:email[] Outbound Email Default

You can now select a Default Outbound Email Account. This will be used as the pre-selected Outbound Account when composing a Campaign or Email.

For newly created users, the first personal outbound created will automatically be set as their default. This can be updated via
the "Actions" dropdown on the record.
